# pipeline-processor

This project implements a pipelined MIPS32 processor using **Verilog**, designed as part of a university course on organization of digital computers, EECS112L. The processor demonstrates a basic RISC-style architecture with a multi-stage pipeline.

Note: This is a simplified version of a project developed for EECS112L at the University of California, Irvine. Many files have been omitted. To maintain academic integrity, only the most important components are shared.

### Key Features
- Implements a **5-stage instruction pipeline**:
  - Fetch
  - Decode
  - Execute
  - Memory
  - Writeback
- Supports the **RISC instruction set**
- Handles basic **data hazards** and **pipeline forwarding**
- Written using the **Verilog 2023.2 standard**
